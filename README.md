# AndrewNg ML Python Notebooks
Machine Learning by Andrew Ng - Implementation in Python

### Exercise 1 : Linear Regression 
#### Univariate LR
- Data Visualizations
- Coding Cost functions and gradient descent from scratch
- Visualizing J($\theta$) cost

#### Multivariate LR 
- Data Visualizations
- Feature Normalization
- Make predictions

### Exercise 2 : Logistic Regression 
- Data Visualizations
- Cost functions and Gradient code from scratch
- Feature normalization
- Apply logistic regression
- Apply regularization
- Visualize boundary of the classification

### Exercise 3 : Multi-Class Classification
- logistic regression Cost and Gradients (multi-class)
#### One vs All 
- OVA and noBias OVA code without built-in OVA functions
- Make predictions
#### Neural Networks 
- Code a neural net predictor
- Make predictions

### Exercise 4 : Multi-Class Classification
